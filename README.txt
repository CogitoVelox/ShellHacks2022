Driving Nanny

Driving-related deaths are on the rise in the United States - with last year showing the largest increase in driving-related deaths in the last 20 years. Often times the best way to change behavior is to make a person know that they will be accountable for their actions. In this vein, we want to curb teenage reckless driving by giving low-tech parents an easy way to see if their new drivers are making rapid movements in the car - slamming the brakes, punching the gas, or swerving quickly. 

By using an Arduino Uno and ADXL345 accelerometer, with some buttons, an LED display and a 3D printed chassis, we have made a simple tool for parents to track the number of bad driving infractions for their kids. All they have to do is hang the device (with it's built-in printed hanger system) onto a rear-view mirror, hit Start, and the Driving Nanny will start recording each dangerous driving infraction, giving the driver a notification each time they are driving unsafely. It has a timer so the driver can't just turn it off - the parent will know how long it's supposed to run for. 

This solution is a great way to make parents and new drivers aware of their driving habits, and will save lives by helping new drivers learn how to take it slow on the roads.
